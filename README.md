# Automatic summarizer

**WARNING:** This repository comes with no documentation, no rationale, and no future.

This is the automatic summarizer from my undergraduate project, which
I have updated to work with the [NLP library](https://github.com/t6/snippets) I developed for my bachelor
report.

Article shown in the screenshot is ['Child asthma drop since smoke ban'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/21116719)
from the CBBC (checked 28.02.2015).

Icons from the [Tango Desktop Project](http://tango.freedesktop.org/).

## Running the summarizer

1. Install [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/)
2. Use `lein run` to start the summarizer UI
3. Select an article under the 'Online articles' tab and click the
   play button in the toolbar. Summarizing will take some time,
   especially the first text.
